Turn out your dough, and divide it if making more than one loaf. Using your hand and a bench scraper, shape your dough into a rough boule and allow to rest for another few minutes.

Allow the dough to settle into a circle, then with lightly floured hands pick up the edge nearest to you and fold it in towards the centre. Do the same with each side, then fold over the far edge and roll the dough in towards you, into a batard.

Dust a banneton with rice flour or plain flour, and using a bench scraper place your shaped batard into it, seam-side up. Pinch the seam closed and dust with a little more flour.
